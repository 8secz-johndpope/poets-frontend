Nuxt front end for Poets
========================

## Build Setup

@TODO: there is no Lando yet; maybe @pirog can help with that.
So for now just run with `yarn run dev`.

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install # Or npm install

# copy the .env.example file to .env
$ cp .env.example .env

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
